                <p>In July 2023, I published "Mythical Affirmations," a coloring book that exemplifies the fusion of artificial intelligence and human creativity. Over a dedicated two-month period, I utilized AI tools to generate initial images, which I meticulously refined and enhanced using Adobe Photoshop. This process involved careful selection, editing, and curation to ensure each illustration met high artistic standards. The project not only showcases my proficiency in integrating AI technology with traditional design techniques but also highlights my commitment to producing engaging and innovative visual content. The printed coloring book is available on <a href="https://a.co/d/hUJDS2E" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/mythical-affirmations-natasha-pierre-louis/1146281112?ean=9798988521716" target="_blank">Barnes and Noble</a> and other retailers.

                  I worked with Natasha for 4.5 years, as a developer on the same team and as her manager. Natasha is an
                  excellent Front-End Developer, her skills in HTML, CSS and graphic design are indispensable. She is a
                  quick learner and loves what she does, her attention to detail is unmatched. Given the opportunity, I
                  would hire her in a heartbeat.

                  of knowing Natasha for over a year, during which we were Front End Developers on the same team at
                  Uniform Advantage. Above all, I was impressed with Natasha's ability to handle the toughest tasks
                  efficiently and fast, she's very talented and capable. And, of course, their professionalism and
                  camaraderie are admirable. Natasha would be a true asset for any positions requiring implementing web

                  comes with my heartfelt recommendation.

                  Natasha is a tenacious front end developer. I had the opportunity to work with Natasha for about a
                  year, and there was no problem that she was not willing to tackle and solve while still meeting
                  deadlines. Natasha is also very open to new ideas and is always putting new tools in her tool belt. I
                  really valued her ability to adapt to different situations and change focus quickly when it was
                  required. It was a pleasure working with Natasha, and she would bring value to any team.

                  Natasha's passion for UI perfection is second-to-none. You can always count on a pristine result when
                  Natasha is doing it. Natasha belongs to the rare breed who understands style very well and is also
                  very analytical and can solve problems way outside of her comfort zone.
                  When Natasha gets going on a task she won't let up until it's finished and perfect. She is always
                  learning about what's new and hot and happy to learn and incorporate the latest and greatest into her
                  work. Any team would be lucky to have her.

                  work with her. Her work is of the highest caliber and she always gets it done on time. Many's the time
                  I've seen her work long and late hours into the night to make a deadline. She was respected and liked
                  by all her co-workers. I hope to have the pleasure of working with her again.

                  Natasha is very talented and creative front end designer. I saw her true passion for web design and
                  user experience while working with her at Citrix. Natasha is very hardworking and has great web
                  technology skills with an eye for detail. She makes her design look perfect before even it goes to
                  internal demo and she has created many beautiful applications at Citrix. It was pleasure working with
                  Natasha, she would be great addition to any team.
