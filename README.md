# Natasha's Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio site — a hand-coded one-pager that showcases my work as a Design Technologist, Front-End Developer, and UI/UX Engineer. This project was built using only HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript — no frameworks or libraries — to highlight my foundational front-end skills and design sensibilities.

## 🧠 Overview

This site includes:

- A responsive layout and custom design
- Dynamic portfolio filtering (JavaScript)
- Accessible navigation with ARIA roles and keyboard support
- Theme switcher (light/dark mode)
- Interactive slide-in project details panel
- Testimonials and contact links
